# Introduction
I did NOT find it all that easy.  Even, after watching several videos and creating a GitHub account.  I want to fill in some of those details.  I particularly want to expain it's use with **PyCharm** and the **UV environment manager** [UV site](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/environments/).    I will focus on my particular work flow.

My friends call me **biG**  (my enemies should NOT call me!) My daily driver OS on my PC is **MX_LINUX** and I use a very abbreviated cursur for the terminal command line: **">"**.  Yep, without any space after it.

# Create GitHub account & initial settings
Well, I don't remember how I actually created it. Here is [biG's GitHub](https://github.com/RichardGoodrich/).  I *Bookmark* it. I also *bookmark* my [repo link](https://github.com/RichardGoodrich?tab=repositories).  (Sometimes I can't seem to get back to it from within certain pages within GitHub?).

*Login* by your **email** or by your **user name**.  I created my login name as: "Richard Goodrich".  However, in use the space is removed to render:  **RichardGoodrich**.  Use a **password management** system to record the details. There are several details **NOT** to forget!  An entry should look something like this:

```
link:    https://github.com/RichardGoodrich
login:  [USER NAME] | [EMAIL]
pwd:    [PWD]
token:  [TOKEN]
```
I stay logged in most of the time.  That may NOT be a good idea!  I get a lot of **SPAM** because of it.  You can login with your [USER NAME] or [EMAIL].  I like to use my [USER NAME].  However, in using GitHub it demands your [EMAIL].  **MOST IMPORTANTLY**, if you want to actually **use** your account you **MUST** create a **TOKEN** and tweak the settings.  GitHub quit allowing use of your **PWD**.

There are two sets of setting that confused me!  There is the **USER ICON** settings found under that top right widget.  I loaded a **PNG** file of myself to make that clear.  Then there is a settings menu on a specific respository page.  Call that the **REPO SETTINGS**. Don't confuse these two!

First get that **token** and record it.  It will disappear from even GitHub.  Watch the video from **References** [1].  Paricularly the short segment on "create token"
### token
```
[USER ICON] - settings - <> developer settings - Personal access tokens -
Tokens (classic) - Generate new token dropdown - Generate new token (classic) -
New Note (write something: "biGtoken") - Expiration dropdown - No Expiration (there are other choices) -
Select Scopes - just check **repo** - push "green" Generate Token -
(copy it - there is a copy icon after it)

Coming back to this path will only allow you to see the name you created in "New Note" and
change some of the token settings or add a new one, etc.
```
