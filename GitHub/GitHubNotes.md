# Introduction
I did NOT find it all that easy.  Even, after watching several videos and creating a GitHub account.  I want to fill in some of those details.  I particularly want to expain it's use with **PyCharm** and the **UV environment manager** [UV site](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/environments/)  I will focus on my particular work flow.
# Create GitHub account & initial settings
Well I don't remember how I actually created it. Here is [biG's GitHub](https://github.com/RichardGoodrich/).  *Bookmark* it, go ahead and *bookmark* your [repo link](https://github.com/RichardGoodrich?tab=repositories) as sometimes I can't seem to get back to it from within certain pages within GitHub?
