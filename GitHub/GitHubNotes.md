# Introduction
I did NOT find it all that easy.  Even, after watching several videos and creating a GitHub account.  I want to fill in some of those details.  I particularly want to expain it's use with **PyCharm** and the **UV environment manager** [UV site](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/environments/).    I will focus on my particular work flow.

My friends call me **biG**  (my enemies should NOT call me!) My daily driver OS on my PC is **MX_LINUX** and I use a very abbreviated cursur for the terminal command line: **">"**.  Yep, without any space after it.

# Create GitHub account & initial settings
Well, I don't remember how I actually created it. Here is [biG's GitHub](https://github.com/RichardGoodrich/).  I *Bookmark* it. I also *bookmark* my [repo link](https://github.com/RichardGoodrich?tab=repositories).  (Sometimes I can't seem to get back to it from within certain pages within GitHub?)  **biG** is what I am called by my friends. 

Logine by your **email** or by your **user name**.  I created my login name as: "Richard Goodrich".  However, in use the space is removed to render:  **RichardGoodrich**.  Use a **password management** system to record the details. There are several details **NOT** to forget!  And entry should look something like this:

```
link:    https://github.com/RichardGoodrich
login:  [USER NAME] | [EMAIL]
pwd:    [PWD]
token:  [TOKEN]
```
I stay logged in most of the time.  That may NOT be a good idea!  I get a lot of **SPAM** because of it.  You can login with your [USER NAME] or [EMAIL].  I like to use my [USER NAME].  However, in using GitHub it will want your [EMAIL].  **MOST IMPORTANTLY**, if you want to actually *use* your account you MUST create a **TOKEN** and tweak the settings.

There are two sets of setting that confused me!  There is the **USER ICON** settings found under that top right widget.  I went a head and loaded a **PNG** file of myself to make that clear.  Then there is a settings menu on the respository page.  Call that the [REPO SETTINGS]
